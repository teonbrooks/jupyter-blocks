# Work Summary

This document summarises the engineering work done to modernise, fix, and
extend the `jupyter-tidyblocks` project from its original
`jupyterlab-blockly` upstream fork into a fully working tidy-data analysis
extension for JupyterLab 4.5.

---

## 1. Dependency modernisation

**Problem:** The project was pinned to JupyterLab 3.x-era packages and the
old `blockly@9` API, both of which are incompatible with a modern JupyterLab
4.x installation.

**What was done:**
- Upgraded all `@jupyterlab/*` peer dependencies from `^3.x` to `^4.5`.
- Upgraded `blockly` from `^9` to `^12` (new serialisation API, new
  generator API, `Order` enum changes).
- Added `@blockly/field-colour` for the colour-picker block.
- Pinned `@jupyterlab/application`, `@jupyterlab/apputils`, and
  `@jupyterlab/services` as Yarn workspace resolutions to prevent nested
  duplicate installs that caused TypeScript type conflicts.
- Added `"lib": ["ES2020", "DOM"]` to the root `tsconfig.json` to fix a
  missing `Intl.ResolvedRelativeTimeFormatOptions` TypeScript error
  introduced by newer `@types/node`.

---

## 2. TypeScript build fixes

All three packages now compile cleanly with zero errors.

| File | Fix |
|---|---|
| `packages/blockly/src/manager.ts` | Changed `KernelConnection` (concrete class) import to `Kernel` namespace for the correct `IKernelConnection \| null` type in `_onKernelChanged`. |
| `packages/blockly/src/registry.ts` | Fixed always-truthy `case 'Sa' \|\| 'Ar':` (TS2872) — split into two separate `case` statements. |
| `packages/blockly/src/widget.ts` | Added missing `private _manager` field and public `get manager()` getter to `BlocklyPanel`. |
| `packages/blockly-extension/src/index.ts` | Added `as any` casts for `LabIcon` and `rendermime` arguments that have minor type divergence across nested `@jupyterlab/*` installs. |
| `packages/tidyblocks/src/generators/python/op.ts` | Replaced non-existent `Order.UNARY` (removed in Blockly 12) with `Order.NONE`. |
| `packages/tidyblocks/src/index.ts` | Changed `registry.addToolbox()` (wrong method name) to `registry.registerToolbox()`. |

---

## 3. Build system fixes

**Problem:** Vite defaulted its output directory to `dist/` but both
`packages/blockly/package.json` and `packages/tidyblocks/package.json`
declared `"main": "lib/index.mjs"` — causing "Cannot find module
'jupyter-tidyblocks'" errors when the extension package tried to import from
them.

**Fix:** Added `build: { outDir: 'lib' }` to `vite.config.ts` in both
`packages/blockly/` and `packages/tidyblocks/`.

**Turborepo ordering:** Added `"dependsOn": ["^build"]` to the build task in
`turbo.json` to guarantee `jupyter-tidyblocks` builds before
`jupyter-tidyblocks-blocks`, which builds before `jupyter-tidyblocks-extension`.

---

## 4. Python package rename

**Problem:** The Python package directory was named `jupyterlab_blockly/`
but the package itself was declared as `jupyter_tidyblocks` in
`pyproject.toml`, causing an import failure when JupyterLab tried to load
the extension.

**Fix:** Renamed the directory to `jupyter_tidyblocks/` and updated all
references:
- `jupyter_tidyblocks/__init__.py` — updated `_jupyter_labextension_paths()`
  destination to `jupyter-tidyblocks-extension`.
- `packages/blockly-extension/package.json` — updated `outputDir` to point
  to `../../jupyter_tidyblocks/labextension`.
- `turbo.json` — updated the `outputs` glob.

---

## 5. Tidy Data blocks — new feature

A full suite of tidy-data analysis blocks was designed and implemented from
scratch, inspired by Greg Wilson's original
[tidyblocks](https://github.com/gvwilson/tidyblocks) project.

### Block categories

| Category | Colour | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| **Data** | `#FEBE4C` | penguins, earthquakes, colors, sequence, user variable, read CSV |
| **Transform** | `#76AADB` | filter, select, drop, create, rename, sort, unique, group by, ungroup, summarize, running, bin, save as, fill NA, drop NA, sample, head, tail, **display table** |
| **Combine** | `#808080` | join, glue, cross join |
| **Plot** | `#A4C588` | bar, box, dot, histogram, scatter, line, violin, heatmap |
| **Stats** | `#BA93DB` | t-test (one/two sample), k-means, silhouette, correlation, describe |
| **Values** | `#E7553C` | column, number, text, logical, datetime, missing, normal, uniform, exponential |
| **Operations** | `#F9B5B2` | arithmetic, compare, logic, not, if/else, typecheck, convert, datetime extract, shift, math, string, str_contains |

### Python code generation

Each block maps to idiomatic pandas / seaborn / plotly Python.  Pipelines
use a `_df` convention — every block reads from and writes back to `_df` —
so blocks can be freely chained without naming variables manually.

The `toplevel_init` mechanism (a custom property on `Blockly.Blocks` entries)
allows block types to declare their required import statements.  These are
collected, deduplicated, and prepended to the generated script automatically.

---

## 6. Registration wiring fix

**Problem:** After building, the Tidy Data category was missing from the
block inventory when opening a `.jpblockly` file.

**Root cause:** `registerTidyblocks()` was never called.  The function was
exported from `jupyter-tidyblocks-blocks` but nothing in the extension's
`activate()` function imported or invoked it.

**Fix:**
1. Added `"jupyter-tidyblocks-blocks": "^0.1.0"` to the extension's
   `package.json` dependencies.
2. Imported `registerTidyblocks` in `packages/blockly-extension/src/index.ts`
   and called it inside `activate()` before returning the registry.

---

## 7. Default toolbox fix

**Problem:** Even after registration, the editor opened showing the generic
"default" Blockly toolbox (Logic, Loops, Math, etc.) rather than Tidy Data.
Users had to manually switch via the toolbar dropdown.

**Fix:** Changed `BlocklyManager`'s constructor to pick the first
non-`'default'` registered toolbox as the initial selection:

```typescript
const registered = [...this._registry.toolboxes.keys()].find(k => k !== 'default');
this._toolbox = registered ?? 'default';
```

---

## 8. Silent crash in workspace change listener

**Problem:** Dragging any block onto the canvas produced no code in the
preview panel and no error message.

**Root cause — Bug 1:** `getBlocksToplevelInit()` used `for...in` to iterate
an array (which yields string indices, not elements) and accessed
`Blockly.Blocks[type]` without a null-check.  When a block type is registered
without a `toplevel_init` property the lookup returns `undefined`, causing a
`TypeError`.  Blockly's event system silently swallows exceptions thrown
inside change listeners.

**Fix:** Rewrote the loop using `for...of`, optional chaining (`?.`), and a
`Set` for deduplication:

```typescript
for (const block of used_blocks) {
  const def = Blockly.Blocks[block.type];
  if (def?.toplevel_init && !seen.has(def.toplevel_init)) {
    seen.add(def.toplevel_init);
    finalToplevelInit += def.toplevel_init;
  }
}
```

**Root cause — Bug 2 (Module Federation):** The `pythonGenerator` instance
stored in `BlocklyRegistry` (imported in `registry.ts`) could be a different
object than the `pythonGenerator` used by tidyblocks generators (imported in
`tidyblocks/src/generators/python/*.ts`) if webpack's Module Federation
treated `blockly/python` as separate bundles.  In that case
`workspaceToCode()` would throw `Error: Unknown block type: tidyblocks_data_penguins`.

**Fix:** Added `registry.registerGenerator('python', pythonGenerator)` to
`registerTidyblocks()`.  This explicitly pushes the tidyblocks-enriched
`pythonGenerator` instance (which already has all `forBlock` handlers
attached) into the registry, overwriting any diverged instance.

---

## 9. Run button fix

**Problem:** Clicking the Run button produced no output and no error message.

**Root cause:** The `catch` handler in `run()` only called `console.error`,
which is invisible in normal JupyterLab usage.  Additionally, when the
workspace was empty the code variable was an empty string but execution was
still attempted.

**Fix:**
- Added an early-exit guard: if the generated code is empty (or whitespace
  only), show a `showErrorMessage` dialog instead of attempting execution.
- Added a `hasNoKernel` guard with a user-facing dialog.
- Replaced `console.error` with `showErrorMessage('Execution error', ...)` so
  failures surface in the UI.

---

## 10. Display table block — new feature

Added a `display table` terminal block to the Transform category that calls
IPython's `display(_df)`, rendering the full HTML representation of the
current DataFrame in the JupyterLab output area.

Implementation touched three files:
- `packages/tidyblocks/src/blocks/transform.ts` — block definition (terminal:
  has `previousStatement` only, no `nextStatement`).
- `packages/tidyblocks/src/generators/python/transform.ts` — generator
  returning `display(_df)\n`.
- `packages/tidyblocks/src/toolbox.ts` — added to the Transform category.
